# Advent of Code '24

This year's challenge is to use a different language every day (choosing from the following list).
The goal is to find the best fitting language in order to write maximally concise and readable code (while also using a wide spread of languages).
Learning new languages/language features is not the primary goal, but it's a likely side-effect (considering the fact I haven't used all of these languages).

As days pass, the languages above the horizontal line match the actual choice for that day.
The languages below the line are sorted (rougly) inversely w/r/t difficulty and generality (factoring in my familiarity with them).

1. APL
1. Haskell
1. Perl
